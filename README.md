# Learning-Box
A Vagrant environment for study.

You need to create this directory path ```~/Documents/dev/shared``` and clone the "Vagrant" folder into the "shared" folder.

Currently the script creates a java environment with:
  - Java 11 (JDK/JRE);
  - IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse (Default);
  - Tomcat 9.0.33;
  - Maven;
  - x11.
